      <h2>Camellia Hills</h2><br>
      <p>Here is a highly contemporary interpretation of a traditional tea bungalow, with just five bedrooms, set in lush gardens, with marvellous lake and hill views. Part of the Teardrop group, it’s in the same stable as The Wallawwa near Colombo, but very different: more private house than hotel.</p>
